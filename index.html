	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<article>Hi, my name is Brandon and this site is a personal HTML and CSS project. I haven't messed with HTML or CSS in a decade, but with the evolution of this site, I hope to relearn and improve upon my knowlegde of these coding languages. I started this website on July 5th, 2020 and have since loved writing my own code, line by line.</article>
		<article>This site is hosted free by GitHub, a company that provides hosting for software development and version control. It uses Git functionality to offer 'distributed version control' and 'source code management.' But me, I simply use it to quickly and easily upload new drafts of this website using the command prompt. It also helps me learn the process that software developers use, in the event I someday want to pursue such a career.</article>
	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
		<article>In Decemeber 2019, after watching the tv series 'Mr. Robot,' I researched PC components and assembly. In January 2020, I bought the components and built my very own PC. Having a powerful setup has renewed my interest in computer science and programming. Being able to dive back into coding and to learn how to control a PC from the command prompt strangely excites me. This website is a work in progress and will be updated as my coding skills progress.</article>
		<article>I am extremely grateful for my partner and family for encouraging me to follow my passions and for my friends who continue to inspire, challenge, and reinvent me.</article>
		<article>My wonderful home in Central Oregon, and the surrounding beautiful Pacific Northwest geography, never cease to amaze me. Mountains, rivers, lakes, desert, ocean, and old-growth forests are all within reach.</article>
		<article><p>Thank you for checking out my website!</p></article>
