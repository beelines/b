<h2><p>Welcome to my site!</p>

<p>My name is Brandon, and I am using this site as training-grounds to relearn web coding. It has been a long time since I played around with html or CSS code. With the evolution of this site I hope to relearn and improve upon my knowlegde of html and CSS. Furthermore, I aspire to learn javascript and come up with a sleek website, that I myself, coded from scratch. If I enjoy the process, I may study java, C#, and Python. Further down the road I could focus on things like a conditional, a loop or functions and classes.</p>

<p>Inspiration: Watching the series 'Mr. Robot' gave me inspiration to learn how to build my own PC and master the use of terminals/command prompts. Other things that inspire me are blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Thank you for checking out my work!</p></h2>
