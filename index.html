		<article><p>My name is Brandon, github codename 'beelines,' and I am using this site as training-grounds to relearn web coding. It has been a long time since I played around with html or css code. With the evolution of this site I hope to relearn and improve upon my knowlegde of html and css. Furthermore, I aspire to learn javascript and come up with a sleek website, that I myself, coded from scratch. If I enjoy the process, I may study java, C#, and Python. Further down the road I could focus on things like conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.</p></article>
		<article><p>In Decemeber 2019, after watching the tv series 'Mr. Robot,' I researched PC components and computer building. In January 2020, I purchased all of my favorite components and built my very own PC. Having a powerful setup has renewed my interest in computer science and programming. Being able to dive back into coding and to learn how to control my PC from the command prompt is a recent passion. This website is a work in progress and will be updated as my coding progresss.</p></article>
