<h2>Welcome to my site! My name is Brandon, and I am using this site as training-grounds to learn how to code. When I was in high school, I made some novice websites. Since that was a long time ago, I am relearning html, CSS, and javascript. In time, I aspire to learn java, C#, and Python. If I stick with it, learning things like a conditional, a loop or functions and classes would be further steps.

I am fascinated by blockchain technology and cybersecurity. The series 'Mr. Robot' was a big inspiration.

Thank you for checking out my work!</h2>
